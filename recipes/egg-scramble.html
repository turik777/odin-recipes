    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This egg scramble recipe is a yummy mix of veggies and eggs, topped with cheese and hot sauce.</p>
    <p>You may also use Indian curry spice or garam masala instead of cayenne and omit the cheese if you like.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 potato, peeled</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>ground cayenne pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 dash hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil. Add potato and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and chop.</li>
        <li>Sauté onion and garlic in a lightly oiled skillet over medium-high heat. When onion is soft, stir in spinach and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and pour in eggs. Cook until the bottom has set, about 2 minutes. Stir in potatoes and tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Season with salt, pepper, cayenne, and hot sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until eggs have set. Sprinkle with grated cheese and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
